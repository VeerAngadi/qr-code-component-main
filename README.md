## Overview
Hi, I tried to build this QR code snippet using only HTML and CSS.
I coded this just after finishing learning HTML and CSS in a online course so thought of practicing my skills through some projects.

TBH I found it very hard and did a lot of Kindaa circus to build this and I know this is not looking exactly but still go hard on me and criticize if I have any silly mistakes which shouldn't be done.

Plese let me know how is it for the first timer and give your feedbacks.

## My process
I stared with HTML and I found it very hard during styling considering my 1st ever project.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS



### What I learned

I learned one thing that it is not as easy as it looks and should work on myself.
I have tried using anything and everything to try and make it look similar.
